# Vibe Coded Monorepo – BeyondChats Assignment

A multi-phase article management system demonstrating scraping, AI-assisted rewriting,
and full-stack integration under realistic time constraints.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project follows a **minimal, reviewer-friendly stack** using only Laravel, React, and Node.js.
The goal is to demonstrate system design clarity, trade-offs, and end-to-end data flow.

### Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User / Browser] <-->|React Frontend| Frontend
    Frontend <-->|REST API| Laravel[Laravel API]
    Laravel <-->|SQL| DB[(SQLite Database)]
    Node[Node.js Script] -->|Fetch Latest Article| Laravel
    Node -->|Search & Scrape| External[Google / Tech Blogs]
    Node -->|Rewrite Content| LLM[LLM Service]
    Node -->|Update Article| Laravel
```

> If the diagram does not render, the flow is:
> **React → Laravel API → SQLite**, with **Node.js** handling scraping and AI rewriting.

## ⚖️ Trade-offs & Key Decisions

### 1. Mocked External Services (Time Constraint)

* **Google Search:** Simulated SERP logic to avoid CAPTCHA and paid API dependencies.
* **LLM:** Rewrite logic is simulated to demonstrate architecture without token costs.
* **Impact:** All internal system interactions are real; only external providers are mocked.

### 2. HTML Rendering & Security

* **Decision:** Used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render AI-generated HTML correctly.
* **Trade-off:** In production, this would require sanitization (e.g. DOMPurify).
  For this assignment, correctness of LLM output rendering was prioritized.

### 3. SQLite Database

* **Decision:** SQLite chosen for zero-configuration setup.
* **Impact:** Lower concurrency, but ideal for local evaluation and assignment scale.

### 4. Monorepo Structure

* **Decision:** Single repository containing:

  * `backend-laravel`
  * `script-node` (Node.js automation)
  * `frontend-react`
* **Benefit:** Easy navigation and holistic system understanding for reviewers.

## 🚀 Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend (Laravel)

```bash
cd backend-laravel
cp .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
php artisan serve
```

### 2. Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Automation Script (Node.js)

```bash
cd script-node
node index.js
```

## 🌐 Live Demo

Due to limited time and to prioritize system design and correctness, the application is not deployed.
The entire project is fully runnable locally using the instructions above.

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

* Scraper selectors are tuned for generic blog layouts.
* SSL verification is disabled only for local scraping experiments to avoid certificate issues.
  This would never be disabled in a production system.

## ✅ Assignment Coverage

* Phase 1: Blog scraping + Laravel CRUD APIs ✔
* Phase 2: Node.js pipeline + AI-assisted rewriting (simulated) ✔
* Phase 3: React frontend displaying original and updated articles ✔
